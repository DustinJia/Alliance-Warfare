In this game, you need to control 3 bubbles that represent for 3 kinds of characters: a tank, an attacker and a healer.

The tank is good at defence, his skill is to attract the monster's attention. So the player should control him to attract the monster 
from chasing others. 

The functionality of the attacker is, well, attack. He can damage the monster well with his skill. But the monster can 
also hurt him a lot, so try your best to keep the monster away from him. 

The player can use the healer to recover others' HP, and also keep her a distance from the monster.

Like other games, this game also have "talent system", which can improve the character's ability. 
Especially for the harder level, making a good talent strategy can relieve the player a lot.
